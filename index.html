              <h6>1. How do I know if the people claiming the free meals are really in need? What if they are rich or just simply <em>kiasu</em>?</h6>
              <div class="faq-answer">
                <p><strong>Belanja Eat</strong> relies on an honour system. Just like all things, there will always be people who abuse it.</p>
                <p>Yet, in these hard times, there are truly people who need the free meal and are too paiseh to ask for help. They may also not qualify for government support or relief yet.</p>
                <p>That's why <strong>Belanja Eat</strong> is a no-questions-asked, no-judgement, pay-it-forward system. Have more faith in people lah.</p>
              </div>
            </div>
            
            <div class="faq-item">
              <h6>2. I am a stall owner. Some of my customers might need a free meal but they don't know about <strong>Belanja Eat</strong>. I also don't want to offend or embarrass them. How do I tell them that there are kind people who would like to <em>belanja</em> them a free meal?</h6>
              <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>Some hawker stall owners have told us their tips! Here's some:</p>
                <p>a) Indirect way:</p>
                <p>"Hello customer! Do you know of anyone who needs a <em>belanja</em>?</p>
                <p>We got kind people who have pre-paid for some meals and it is free!</p>
                <p>No need to apply, no need paiseh. Super simple. Times are bad lah, that's why must help one another!"</p>
                <p>b) Share about <strong>Belanja Eat</strong>:</p>
                <p>"Wah, these are really jialat times. I'm sure a lot of people would need a free meal.</p>
                <p>See... this <strong>Belanja Eat</strong> project good, machiam kampung spirit lah - if you've some extra, you buy a meal for others. If you need, just take a free meal. Sharing is caring!"</p>
              </div>
            </div>
            
            <div class="faq-item">
              <h6>3. Do I need to "interview" every customer redeeming a free meal to make sure they are really needy?</h6>
              <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>No lah! Please don't "interview" or reject anyone who asks for a <strong>Belanja Eat</strong> free meal.</p>
                <p>We can't always tell who needs a meal just based on how they look. Some may have just lost a job, or are having a hard time at home.</p>
                <p>Don't go and make them paiseh by interviewing them, rejecting them or staring at them up and down ok.</p>
                <p>We all go through rough periods and this is a challenging time. Let's help one another and trust each other more. The donors of the meals have the same trust too!</p>
              </div>
            </div>
            
            <div class="faq-item">
              <h6>4. What if the same customer comes back often to claim a free meal?</h6>
              <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>It's ok! Please smile and offer the customer the free meal. Don't reject or stare at the person ok? It's not easy for the customer to be coming forward to request for a free meal. Like many of us, he/she may be going through a difficult period.</p>

              <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>As <strong>Belanja Eat</strong> is currently managed by volunteers, we plan to run this initiative to <u><strong>10 August 2020</strong></u>. We will discontinue active management of the website & our social media operations then.</p>
                <p>That said, individual hawker/F&B stall owners are welcome to decide if they wish to continue with the initiative on their own - we've tried to simplify the process as much as possible so that any one can implement it!</p>

            <p>This is our Singaporean take on paying it forward - <em>Belanja</em>!</p>
            <p>We are just a small group and our resources are limited. So we want to make it as easy as possible for anyone to use these resources to start a <strong>Belanja Eat</strong> on their own as a small act when you get your own food.<br>At the same time the hawkers and F&B stalls that host our <em>Belanja</em>s can continue to stay in business. Win-win!</p>
